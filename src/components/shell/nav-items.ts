/**
 * Shared navigation data for the desktop sidebar AND the mobile drawer.
 *
 * The mobile drawer used to carry its own hardcoded list of 11 links —
 * out of ~226 routes, eight of them sharing a single generic icon — so
 * phone users could reach a tenth of the app, and the two lists were
 * free to drift apart with nothing to catch it. CLAUDE.md notes most
 * SEOs check rankings on a phone, which made that the wrong place to
 * cut corners.
 *
 * One definition, two renderers.
